This is a graphical experiment in which, given a set of points on a 2D plane, efficiently finds all sets of 4 or more collinear points, and draws line segments connecting those points.

To run, execute Collinear, with the name of any of the text files in the root directory as the parameter (e.g. mystery10089.txt).
